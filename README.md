## Frank:
Count (Poisson) effect dose response analysis, categorical and numerical GLM.

.r script is at [poissonGLM.r](https://gist.github.com/eastandrew/79ba85e9e0f6502fe088c3f09985b717).

## Survival at time:
To interpolate survival at time rather than time-specific effect values that are not at desired times (7 vs 5,8).  

.r script is at [survivaltime.r](https://gist.github.com/eastandrew/422f3334360b4a76c92f6c5c70c6a871).
